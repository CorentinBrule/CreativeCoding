<p style="margin-top: 1.2em;"><strong><a id="a" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;"></a>1. GENERAL RULES AND DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>1.1 If you choose to use NYTimes.com (the “Site”), NYT’s mobile sites and applications, any of the features of this site, including but not limited to RSS, API, software and other downloads (collectively, the "Services"), you will be agreeing to abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service between you and The New York Times Company ("NYT", “us” or “we”).</p>
<p>1.2 We may change, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time, which shall become effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service prior to each use of the Site and by continuing to use this Site, you agree to any changes.</p>
<p>1.3 IF ANY OF THESE RULES OR ANY FUTURE CHANGES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP BY SENDING E-MAIL TO: <a href="mailto:cancel@nytimes.com">cancel@nytimes.com</a> (SEE SECTION 10.1 REGARDING TERMINATION OF SERVICE). YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES NOW, OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF NOTICE OF ANY CHANGES IN THESE OPERATING RULES, WILL INDICATE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF SUCH RULES, CHANGES, OR MODIFICATIONS.</p>
<p>1.4 We may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including the availability of any Services feature, database, or content. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.</p>
<hr />
<p style="margin-top: 1.2em;"><strong><a id="b" class="element1 question_text" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;"></a>2. CONTENT ON THE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>2.1 The contents of the Services, including the Site, are intended for your personal, noncommercial use. All materials published on the Services (including, but not limited to news articles, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video clips, also known as the "Content") are protected by copyright, and owned or controlled by The New York Times Company or the party credited as the provider of the Content. You shall abide by all additional copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Service.</p>
<p>2.2 The Services and Contents are protected by copyright pursuant to U.S. and international copyright laws. You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in Section 2.3 of these Terms of Service), create new works from, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit, any of the Content or the Services (including software) in whole or in part.</p>
<p>2.3 You may download or copy the Content and other downloadable items displayed on the Services for personal use only, provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained therein. Copying or storing of any Content for other than personal use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/permissions/permissions.html">The New York Times Rights and Permissions Department</a>, or the copyright holder identified in the copyright notice contained in the Content.</p>
<p>2.4 The Content of the Services is owned or licensed to NYT. Certain Content is furnished by the Associated Press and Reuters, which will not be liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions in any such Content, or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof, or for any damages arising therefrom.</p>
<hr />
<p style="margin-top: 1.2em;"><strong><a id="discussions" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;"></a>3. USER GENERATED CONTENT: SUBMISSIONS INCLUDING COMMENTS, READER REVIEWS AND MORE</strong></p>
<p>3.1 You shall not upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish on to the Services any libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or otherwise illegal material.</p>
<p>Be courteous. You agree that you will not threaten or verbally abuse other Members, use defamatory language, or deliberately disrupt discussions with repetitive messages, meaningless messages or "spam."</p>
<p>Use respectful language. Like any community, the online conversation flourishes only when our Members feel welcome and safe. You agree not to use language that abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual preference, age, region, disability, etc. Hate speech of any kind is grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Services.</p>
<p>Debate, but don't attack. In a community full of opinions and preferences, people always disagree. NYT encourages active discussions and welcomes heated debate on the Services, but personal attacks are a direct violation of these Terms of Service and are grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service.</p>
<p>3.2 The Services shall be used only in a noncommercial manner. You shall not, without the express approval of NYT, distribute or otherwise publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, advertising or solicitation for goods or services.</p>
<p>3.3 You acknowledge that any submissions you make to the Services (i.e., user-generated content including but not limited to: comments, forum messages, reviews, text, video, audio and photographs, as well as computer code and applications) (each, a "Submission") may be edited, removed, modified, published, transmitted, and displayed by The New York Times Company and you waive any rights you may have in having the material altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. Submissions made to the Services may also be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and made available for republishing through other formats.</p>
<p>3.4 You grant NYT a perpetual, nonexclusive, world-wide, royalty free, sub-licensable license to the Submissions, which includes without limitation the right for NYT or any third party it designates, to use, copy, transmit, excerpt, publish, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, modify and adapt (including without limitation the right to adapt to streaming, downloading, broadcast, mobile, digital, thumbnail, scanning or other technologies) in any form or media now known or hereinafter developed, any Submission posted by you on or to the Services or any other Web site owned by NYT, including any Submission posted on or to the Services through a third party.</p>
<p>3.5 You are solely responsible for the content of your Submissions. However, while NYT does not and cannot review every Submission and is not responsible for the content of these messages, NYT reserves the right to delete, move, or edit Submissions that it, in its sole discretion, deems abusive, defamatory, obscene, in violation of copyright or trademark laws, or otherwise unacceptable.</p>
<p>3.6 By making a Submission, you are consenting to its display and publication on the Site and in the Services and for related online and offline promotional uses.</p>
<p><!--added March 2004 TB --> 3.7 Any person involved in or affiliated with the production of a work reviewed on NYTimes.com or elsewhere in the Services may not submit a Readers' Review for that work or competing works.</p>

Being exposed to advertising is a condition of accessing the Services.</p>
<p>4.2 The Services contain links to other related World Wide Web Internet sites, resources, and advertisers. Since we are not responsible for the availability of these outside resources, or their contents, you should direct any concerns regarding any external link to such site.</p>
<hr />
<p style="margin-top: 1.2em;"><strong><a id="f" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;"></a>5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong></p>
<p>5.1 You represent, warrant and covenant (a) that no materials of any kind submitted through your account will (i) violate, plagiarize, or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy or other personal or proprietary rights; or (ii) contain libelous or otherwise unlawful material; and (b) that you are at least thirteen years old. You hereby indemnify, defend and hold harmless NYT and all officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers, affiliates, licensors and licensees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liability and costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you or any user of your account of these Terms of Service or the foregoing representations, warranties and covenants. You shall cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any such claim. NYT reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.</p>
<p>5.2 NYT does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Services by any user, information provider or any other person or entity.

YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>
<hr />

<p>6.1 As part of the registration or account creation process, you will create login credentials by selecting a password and providing an e-mail address. You also have to give us certain registration information, all of which must be accurate and updated.</p>
<p>Each registration is for a single user only. You are not allowed to share your registration login credentials or give your login credentials to anyone else. We may cancel or suspend your access to the NYT Services if you share your login credentials. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, which you will not have to reveal to any representative or agent of NYT.

Failure to comply with the foregoing shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Service, which may result in immediate suspense or termination of your account.</p>
<p>6.2 Please notify <a href="mailto:help@nytimes.com">help@nytimes.com</a> of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information.</p>

<p>6.4 You are responsible for all usage or activity on your NYTimes.com account, including use of the account by any third party authorized by you to use your login credentials.

<p style="margin-top: 1.2em;"><strong><a id="h" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000;"></a>7. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></p>
<p>7.1. We reserve the right at any time to charge fees for access to portions of the Services or the Services as a whole. However, in no event will you be charged for access to the Services unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such charges. Thus, if at any time we require a fee for portions of the Services that are now free, we will give you advance notice of such fees. You may cancel your account at any time. All new fees, if any, will be posted prominently on the Site and in other appropriate locations on the Service. You shall pay all fees and charges incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred, including, but not limited to charges for any digital products or services offered for sale through the Services by us or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and charges shall be billed to and paid for by you. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to use of the Services through your account.</p>

<p>8.2 NYT reserves the right to send electronic mail to you for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to the Service.</p>
