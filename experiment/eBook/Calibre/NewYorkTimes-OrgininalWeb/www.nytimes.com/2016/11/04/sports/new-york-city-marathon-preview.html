Adding tens of thousands of people to the field over the decades has turned race management into a science. One of the most difficult tasks is keeping runners moving through the relatively narrow streets of the first few miles. That is why the start is staggered into four waves on three color-coded routes (each with their own “start village” at Fort Wadsworth). And it is why runners are further divided into crowd-control corrals at the start.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="5732">It is here in Bay Ridge, between Miles 2 and 3, where the three routes are most separate. Athletes in the blue stream (the elite men and women follow this route) are the first to exit the highway off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge onto Dahlgren Place. They hang a left at 92nd Street and a right onto Fourth Avenue, where they will settle in for the next five and a half miles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="5909">The orange stream exits at 92nd Street, abruptly loops back toward the bridge and takes a right turn and then another right onto Fourth Avenue, merging with their blue brethren.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="6212">And then there are the greenies, who ran on the lower level of the bridge. While the upper-level blue and orange people quickly exit to streets, the greenies stay on the Gowanus Expressway a bit longer, in the southbound lanes, which everyone hopes will be a little less congested than during rush hour.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="6479">They exit at 79th Street, continuing north on Seventh Avenue. The greenies hang a left on 74th Street, which gives runners an exclusive passage down a classic New York melting pot of a street, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/sports/marathon-thrills-take-detour-through-a-sleepy-block-in-bay-ridge.html">one profiled in 2011</a> in The Times.

These are some fine distractions from, ouch, that knee. A glance to the right at 103rd Street reveals one of the most special areas of Central Park, the <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/north-end/conservatory-garden-fountain.html">Conservatory Garden</a>.

They were part of the original park plan, but the names were not chiseled until the second half of the 1900s. Did I mention that we’re going uphill?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="46237">On the left side of Fifth, the cultural hits keep coming.

Hamilton, and dedicated in 1881. Mental soundtrack alert No. 1: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS79uxNFoHw">Ten Duel Commandments</a>,” from the musical “Hamilton,” is a good cadence keeper, with its “one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-niiiiine.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="352" data-total-count="47587">Farther right, through the trees, is <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/great-lawn.html">the Great Lawn</a>, where in 1983 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9BE6F5MfQY">Diana Ross</a> became a New York symbol of perseverance (like Hamilton) when she sang to hundreds of thousands of people through a torrential downpour.

At about 3,600 years old, it’s the oldest outdoor object in the city to be made by humans. Don’t try to read the hieroglyphics while running.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="48362">Walking down stairs may be difficult for the next few days, but wise is the runner who embraces the next four-tenths of a mile, a gentle winding glide downhill. Beats going up, right?

Regardless, the park feels different right now. There is temporary lining on either side of the road, creating a slight tunnel effect, and the crowds and sounds and disorientation from having run so far can make familiar places seem foreign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="49234">The racecourse peels off from the main park loop and continues south, and downhill, toward the <a href="http://www.theplazany.com/">Plaza Hotel</a>, with just a mile to go.
